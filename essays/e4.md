<h1>Reflecting on My Programming Journey:</h1>
<h2>Areas of Improvement:</h2>
While my programming skills have seen significant growth, I acknowledge that there are areas where I need to enhance my independence. Specifically, I aspire to develop the ability to intuitively formulate code solutions, without relying heavily on external references. My goal is to grasp JavaScript intricacies, such as the strategic use of parameters, without explicit guidance. Although I've made progress, I recognize the importance of fostering a deeper understanding to tackle challenges independently.
<h2>Learning from POKEs:</h2>
Undoubtedly, POKEs have been instrumental in my learning journey. Although I still find myself grappling with input validation – perhaps a lingering effect from early Labs – I appreciate the strides I've made. While initial guidance is essential, I've gained confidence in translating requirements into functional code. Professor Sal's approach to explaining the rationale behind code has significantly contributed to my learning process.
<h2>Success with Labs:</h2>
The Labs have been a cornerstone of my learning experience. Professor Sal's clear explanations and insights into the necessity of certain code components have played a pivotal role in boosting my confidence. With his guidance, I've navigated through the Labs with a newfound sense of assurance.
<h2>Reflection on Assignment 1:</h2>
Assignment 1 was a valuable learning experience. It shed light on the importance of meticulous variable management and the significance of well-placed comments. While I recognize the need for comments, I'm also navigating the balance between clarity and conciseness. This awareness has been especially pronounced as I delve into Assignment 2, where refining my coding practices remains a focus.
<h2>Suggestions for Improvement:</h2>
Looking ahead, I believe allocating more time for material review before Assignment 2 would be beneficial. The anticipation of Assignment 3 has induced some anxiety, and additional preparation time would alleviate concerns. I express gratitude for Professor Sal's enhanced guidance in Labs, WODs, POKEs, and Assignments, which have greatly contributed to my learning experience since the course material restructuring.
<h2>Key Learning Resources:</h2>
Among the array of resources, Sal's videos stand out as my primary aid. I find myself revisiting them multiple times to solidify my understanding of the subject matter. The clarity and depth provided in these videos have been instrumental in my learning journey.
