*I am excited and nervous to take this class.*

I am taking ITM 352 because it aligns perfectly with my academic and career goals, providing me with a strong foundation in programming and software development concepts, which are essential in today's technology-driven world.

Firstly, the course aims to familiarize students with basic programming principles. In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, understanding how to code is no longer a specialized skill; it's a necessity. Whether one's background is in IT or not, acquiring rudimentary programming skills, as emphasized in ITM 352, is crucial. This course acknowledges that everyone can learn these skills and provides a supportive environment for doing so.

Secondly, ITM 352 introduces students to development environments, such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). These tools are fundamental for any aspiring programmer. They streamline the development process, making it more efficient and organized. Gaining proficiency in using IDEs will not only be beneficial in this course but will also serve me well throughout my ITM major and in my future career.

Furthermore, the course's emphasis on planning, designing, programming, documenting, and testing web-based e-service applications reflects the comprehensive nature of modern software development. These are skills and strategies that are highly transferable and will be invaluable as I progress in my ITM studies and eventually enter the workforce.

Lastly, ITM 352 offers hands-on experience in introductory-level programming, which is essential for building a strong foundation. Learning by doing is often the most effective way to acquire knowledge, and this course provides ample opportunities for practical application.

## To Conclude....
In conclusion, I am taking ITM 352 because it equips me with the skills and knowledge necessary for success in the ITM field. It aligns perfectly with my academic and career aspirations, and I am excited to embark on this journey of exploration and learning.
